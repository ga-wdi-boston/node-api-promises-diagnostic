// Write a function to sum the numbers in a file.
//
// This function should take the name of a plain text file with one number per
// line, as in data/integers.txt.
// It should return a Promise resolved with the sum of the numbers.
//
// Blank lines should be ignored.
// However, if there is a line with non-numeric content (e.g. "oops"),
// The Promise returned should be rejected.
//

// I'll take the hit on this one. Can't concentrate with all of the random room sounds.
